# SOLID

### An acronym that stands for five software design principles that aim to improve the quality and maintainability of code. These principles are especially relevant in object-oriented programming.


## Main Principles

```
S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) : This principle states that a class should have a single reason to change, i.e. it should have a single responsibility. This means that each class should be responsible for only one part of the programme's functionality, which makes it easier to maintain and understand.


O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP) : This principle indicates that ‘entities’ (such as classes, modules or functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that it should be possible to add new functionality to a class without modifying its existing code, which can be achieved by inheritance or composition.


L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) : This principle states that the objects of a derived class must be able to replace the objects of the base class without altering the correct functioning of the program. In other words, if a class A is a subclass of B, then it must be possible to use A in place of B without errors occurring.


I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) : This principle suggests that it is better to have many specific interfaces rather than a single general interface. Clients should not be forced to rely on interfaces that they do not use. This promotes the creation of smaller, more specific interfaces that are easier to implement and maintain.


D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) : This principle states that dependencies must be on abstractions and not on concretes. In other words, high-level classes should not depend on low-level classes, but both should depend on abstractions (such as interfaces or abstract classes). This helps to reduce coupling and increase the flexibility of the system.

#### Applying these principles can help developers create systems that are more flexible, scalable and easier to maintain

##### All the explanation of SOLID, and as a team we have made a presentation in Canva of the letter “I” of ISP (Interface segregation principle).

## All of this will be uploaded to an Obsidian
